#Features that are working:
 - The book structure is in place, such as there being a title page, a forward page, a table of contents with working buttons,
   and all of the pages containing prose.
 - The prose may be altered by the user by selecting from various options.
 - Paragraph layout and general naive font choices have been made.
 
#Features not yet implemented:
 - The illustrations are not yet integrated into the program.
 - There isn't yet any instructions that tell people that they
   can navigate using the left and right onscreen buttons or the left and right arrow keys on their personal keyboard.
 - People may not know to click on the variable words to change their choices.
 - Exporting to PDF Documents.
 - Better User experiences, such as being able to drag pages and see pages flip, rather than the current slide show like effect.
 - A sophisticated review of the font choices and sizes. 
 - The Title page needs to be revamped with paragraph native line breaks.
 - Some of the longer option texts overflow the option buttons horizontally, which is a bug.
 - All of the objects and background need to be better integrated.
 - I need to finish logically associating choices to collections of background and object names.
